# Simularity

> Run interactive simulations locally, or in cloud.

This project aims to implement a foundation for self-hosted interactive simulation applications.

The closest description for the project right now is "AI-driven visual novels".

## Foundation

This project implements a base for future interactive simulation applications, presumably with application-specific modules and assets.

Ideally, a typical application workflow includes development of the assets only (such as scenarios, characters, images, UI elements etc.), so that all the foundation is re-used.
