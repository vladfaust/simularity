# Simularity

> Run interactive simulations locally, or in cloud.

This project aims to implement a foundation for self-hosted interactive simulation applications.

The closest description for the project right now is "AI-driven visual novels".

## Foundation

This project implements a base for future interactive simulation applications, presumably with application-specific modules and assets.

Ideally, a typical application workflow includes development of the assets only (such as scenarios, characters, images, UI elements etc.), so that all the foundation is re-used.

## Image Generation

To create a sprite from existing assets, use the following steps.

1. Img2Img an existing naked sprite:

- Model: T-ponyai3
- Crop & Resize
- No Soft Inpainting
- Denoising: 0.8

```
score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, source_anime,
1girl, looking at viewer,
blue beautiful hair, blue eyes, small breasts, cat ears,
naked,
scenario assets, 3/4 body sprite, hips, anti aliased, white background,
standing,
rating_explicit
```

1. An alternative to existing assets is creating in a batch with the same seed, e.g.

```prompt-positive
score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, source_anime, rating_explicit,
scenario assets, 3/4 body sprite, hips, anti aliased, bright green background,
1girl,
short black hair, red eyes, small breasts, slim body, cat ears,
naked, standing, looking at viewer,
{neutral|happy|smile|sad|angry|surprised|embarrassed|confused|fearful|determined|bored|anxious|excited|tired|annoyed|playful|curious|fanged smile|pout|ahegao|crying|shy|worried}
```

```prompt-negative
score_4,score_3,score_2,score_1, username, watermark, clothing
```

1152x1536 is a good size for a sprite.
Should explore the area of two inpainting the second sprite on the same image for character consistency.

Multiple poses approach ((1024x2)x1366):

```prompt-positive
score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, source_anime,
scenario assets, 3/4 body sprite, character sheet, multiple poses, anti aliased, bright green background,
1girl,
aqua, konosuba,
standing, looking at viewer, white sleepwear, consistent outfit, same outfit
```

2. Send to inpainting

- Just resize
- Soft Inpainting
- Denoising: 0.7
- Use dynamic prompt & combinatorial generation

```
score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, source_anime, rating_explicit,
scenario assets, 3/4 body sprite, hips, anti aliased, bright green background,
1girl,
short black hair, red eyes, small breasts, slim body, cat ears,
{pioneer neckerchief, pioneer movement soviet pioneer, skirt, blue skirt, bangs, shirt, school uniform, collarbone, white shirt, short sleeves, collared shirt, belt, neckerchief, eyelashes, red neckerchief, pocket, breast pocket|swim one piece suit|bikini|black lingerie|white lingerie|black sport suit|red evening dress|summer dress|tshirt, shorts|naked},
{smiling|shy|sad|crying|surprised|feared|ahegao}, standing, looking at viewer,
```

TIP: Can use ES lora to extract pioneer suit: `(white_shirt,red neckerchief,short sleeves,belt,skirt, blue skirt)`.
